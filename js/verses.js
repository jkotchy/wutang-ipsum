	"Bust this, I'm kicking like Seagal, Out for Justice. The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus. Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue. Murder one, my style shock ya knot like a stun-gun. I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness.",
	
	"Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown. By this nasty-ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA. Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger. So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab. I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on.",

	"Well I'm the sire, I set the microphone on fire. Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah. I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from. Is coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns.",
	
	"So if you wanna come sweating, stressing contesting. You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection. Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk. Phony niggas are outlined in chalk. I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me. Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me. Steamrolling niggas like a eighteen wheeler. With a drunk driver driving, there's no surviving.",
	
	"Put the needle to the groove I gets rude and I'm forced. To fuck it up, my style carries like a pick-up truck. Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shining sea. I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T.",

	"It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling. Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival I peep at the shape of the streets. And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep.",
	
	"A man with a dream with plans to make cream. Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen. A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much. Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch. ",
	
	"The court played me short, now I face incarceration. Pacin' - going upstate's my destination. Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us. Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough. But as the world turns I learned life is hell. Living in the world no different from a cell. ",
	
	"Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase, selling base. Smoking bones in the staircase. Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess. I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed. But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth. Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth. ",
	
	"Who explained working hard may help you maintain. To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain. We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and. Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot. Leave it up to me while I be living proof. To kick the truth to the young Black youth.",
	
	"But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer. And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear. Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted. That what, that life is hectic.",
	
	"I smoke on the mic like smokin' Joe Frazier. The hell-raiser, raising hell with the flavor. Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan. Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman. ",
	
	"So uhh, tick tock and keep ticking. While I get you flipping off the shit that I'm kicking. The Lone Ranger, code red: danger! Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart. The vandal, too hot to handle. You battle, you're saying goodbye like Tevin Campbell. Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set. The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal.",
	
	"Yo butter butter. Peace. Word up Wu-Tang in the house though.",
	
	"I guess alot of people in ya. I guess they can feel the realness you. They could feel the vibe. And I think hip hop, that's what I be tellin a lot of people. Alot of record promoters and alot of artists. I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel.",
	
	"You know what I'm sayin. And I think that comes across well in the video. I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance. But I'm pretty sure that's probaly what's it like. You know you probaly really get into it. I guess I hear it in your voices when you sayin the rhymes. Um, what ya say ya style is?"

	"Three o'clock in the morning, something got to give. Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next. Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex. He seemed to ignore, I said, Be for real! She's not even worth it to go raw deal.",

	"Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory. I'm surprised, he's still living to tell his story. But he carried on with the same old stuff. With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck. Moe tried to be down with O.P.P. Ain't nothing wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. Now no life to live, doc says two more years. So after the laughter I guess comes the tears."

	"You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus. And I provoke niggas to kick buckets. I'm wetting CREAM, I ain't wetting fame. Who selling cain, I'm giving out a deadly game. It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushing roulette. Slip up and get fucked like Suzette. Bring da fucking ruckus.",

	"The Wu is coming through, the outcome is critical. Fucking with my style is sort of like a miracle. On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald. I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow cause the ho didn't win.",

	"But the sun will still come out tomorrow. And shine shine shine like gold mine. Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine. Pass the bone, kid pass the bone. Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones, the GZA. One who just represent the Wu-Tang clique. With the game and soul of an old school flick.",

	"Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids. Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids. So stop, the life you save may be your motherfucking own. I'll hang your ass with this microphone. Make way for the merge of traffic. Wu-Tang's coming through with full metal jackets. God squad that's mad hard to serve. Come fronting hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves.",

	"No response while I bomb that ass. You ain't shit, your wack ass town had you gassed.",

He throws the signs I hook up the beats with clout. I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike em out. So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue. You can't fuck with those in the major leagues.",

	"For trying to blow up a scrub. Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb. Should've pumped it when I rocked it. Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets. This goes on in some companies. ",

	"With majors, they're scared to death to pump these. First of all, who's your A&R? A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar? But he don't know the meaning of dope. When he's looking for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap.",
